# Training Module

This module will contain model training scripts and utilities.

## Planned Functionality

- **Model Definition**: PyTorch model architectures (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet)
- **Training Loop**: Training script with loss calculation, optimization, and validation
- **Checkpointing**: Save and load model checkpoints
- **Metrics**: Track accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score during training
- **Logging**: TensorBoard or similar logging for training metrics

## Implementation Plan

1. Define the model architecture using PyTorch
2. Implement training loop with forward/backward passes
3. Add validation loop to monitor model performance
4. Implement checkpoint saving/loading
5. Add metrics tracking and visualization
